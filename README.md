# Welcome to Frosztega Software Engineering

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/frosoft/hello.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/frosoft/hello)

I have written this site with the intention of demonstrating some code and learning some things.

It's written in EmberJS; a framework I am very familiar with. Although I've been using the new Octane & Glimmer components
which up til now I've not had a chance to try out.

Much of the dynamic functionality written into the site is original 
(and slightly experimental). Where possible, this has been written using TDD; 
an approach I am an advocate for.

The site applies Continuous Delivery using Travis CI and GitHub pages.

Automate Everything!
