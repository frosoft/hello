# frosoft.github.io

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/frosoft/frosoft.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/frosoft/frosoft.github.io)

I have written this site with the sole intention of showing off some code and learning some things.

It's written in EmberJS; a framework I am very familiar with. Although I've been using the new Octane & Glimmer components
which up til now I've not had a chance to try out.

This has also been an opportunity to try out travis CI and github pages. 

Automate Everything!
